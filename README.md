# ment-or-ship

This app is based off of a tutorial by a code fellows alum about modeling
has-many-through relationships using jedis and their padawans through
apprenticeships. Jedis can have many padawans apprenticed to them while padawans
can have many Jedi masters. All of this is accomplished through the longstanding
tradition of apprenticeships! May the force be with you.
